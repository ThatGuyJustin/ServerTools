# ServerTools-1.18.2
A mod I made for my small private SMP Server.

# Setup
Pop the jar into mods folder, edit config, reboot server

# Commands
`!mc-register` - Registers all the discord /commands

**The slash commands are as follows**

| Command | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| /ping | Pong! |
| /tps | Shows current TPS. |
| /server | Same as above command. |
| /list | Gives you the online list. |
| /time | Shows time until restart. |
| /lilly | üëá‚è¨‚¨á |
| /disconnect | Allows you to force disconnect yourself if your client crashes but are still connected to the server. |

##Features
* The server auto-restarts every 6 hours as that's typically recommended for MC Forge.
* Timer for the auto restart
* Minecraft <-> Discord Chat bridge (With support RGB for Users role color)
* Makes player invulnerable upon login until the player either moves or interacts with the world to avoid death upon login
